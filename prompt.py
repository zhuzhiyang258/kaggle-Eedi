**Input**:  
- Problem: This is part of a table of values for the equation \( y=3x \) ![A table with two rows and two columns. The top left box has 'x', with a star in the top right box. The bottom left box has 'y' with a 9 in the bottom right box.] What should replace the star? Associated knowledge point: Given a positive y-value, find the corresponding x-value for equations in the form \( y=mx+c \).  
- Correct answer: \( 3 \)  
- Student's incorrect answer: \( 6 \)
